## Second Step: Look up any YouTube to WAV converters online!
Once you have your YouTube video chosen and ready to go, all you have to do next is look up any YouTube to WAV converter online. Most of them will only need the YouTube video link and a couple of minutes depending on the length of the video. <br>
A good one that I often use is this: [https://www.youtubetowav.net/](https://www.youtubetowav.net/)<br>

## Third Step: Download the WAV file!
Once the website finished converting your YouTube video, go ahead and download that WAV file for later use. Once your computer has finished this download, you can move on to the next step!
